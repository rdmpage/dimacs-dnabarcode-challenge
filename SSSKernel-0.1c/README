Installation:
-------------
Copy the tar file SSSKernel-0.1c.tar.gz to your directory
> tar xzvf SSSKernel-0.1c.tar.gz
> cd SSSKernel-0.1c
> make

This will produce object files and executables for spatial kernel
computations:
tripleKernel : computes triple kernel matrices
doubleKernel : computes double kernel matrices


Usage:
------
to compute triple(1,d) kernel:
./tripleKernel <Sequence-file> <d> <Alphabet-size>
to compute double(1,d) kernel:
./doubleKernel <Sequence-file> <d> <Alphabet-size>
where
<Sequence-file> is the file with sequence data (one sequence per line,
with sequence elements separated by space, all sequence elements are
assumed to be in the range [0, <AlphabetSize> - 1]), see 
example_seq.txt for example of the sequence file format.
<d> is the kernel parameter (max. distance between samples)
<Alphabet-size> is the size of the alphabet

Output kernel matrix is written into
  kernel.txt
file.

There are also files with sample sequences
 example_seq.txt
and corresponding reference kernel matrices
 example_kernel_double.txt and
 example_kernel_triple.txt
(use 
  ./doubleKernel example_seq.txt 5 1024
  ./tripleKernel example_seq.txt 3 1024
 to reproduce).

ToDo:
-----
- This is a preliminary version for research purposes.
  Parameters, option handling, checking need to be added.
